#You're going to need an OpenAI API key.

An API key is a unique identifier that allows a user or an application to access an API (Application Programming Interface). It's like a password that is required to make a request to the API server or use its functionalities.

Get an OpenAI API key here.

Once you have your key, you're going to need to save it as an environment variable.

To do this, you can use Replit's "Secrets" tool. On the left under your file explorer, you'll see a "tools" section. You're going to want to click on the "Secrets" tool. It's the one with the lock icon.

Once in the Secrets Tool, do the following:

enter "OPENAI_API_KEY" in the "key" input
enter your OpenAI API Key in the "value" input
click the "Add new secret" button
This will securely save your key and allow you to access it in your code.
